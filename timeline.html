        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Technology and its myriad aspects enthuses me! Since my childhood, I was always enamored by gadgets and
            mechanics around me. Watching Discovery and National Geographic channel was something I cherished. They
            eventually led me towards appreciating nuances of technology and engineering marvels and gradually my
            penchant for them grew manifold.</p>
        <p>
            My predilection towards science was fostered during my schooling at<a href="http://hbkapadia.com/"
                                                                                  target="_blank"> H.B.Kapadia High
            School,</a> one of the most reputed schools in the state. As a student, I partake in science fairs,
            presented projects in science exhibitions, and shined out to bring laurels for my school. I won at school as
            well as the state level in various competitions like National Maths Convention organized by All India
            Ramanujan Maths Club, Vikram Sarabhai Model Rocket Competition et al to name a few. Making working models
            gave me immense pleasure and I started believing that imagination combined with invention and execution can
            make breakthrough developments possible.</p>
